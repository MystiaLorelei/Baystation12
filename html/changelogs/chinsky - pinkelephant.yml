changes: 
  - tweak: "Changed way hallucinations are. Now some things will give you strong ones, some milder, it's not always same."
  - tweak: "Most of old hallucinations effects are replaced. New ones are supposed to be more mindfucky."
  - tweak: "Synaptizine, Paroxetone and Citalopram help lowering frequency of hallucinations, and to clear them out faster once whatever causes them is dealt with."
