changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new, more expensive type of 14.5mm ammo, for the anti-material rifle: APDS. Less damage, but far greater armour penetration."
  - rscadd: "Projectiles can now cause internal damage, including organ damage and severing arteries. Bullets cause more than energy, with x-ray lasers being inbetween the two."
  - tweak: "Renamed 5.56mm ammo to 7.62mm and vice versa, to be more consistent with their damage values."
  - tweak: "Matebas now use .50 ammo, while revolvers have had their damage reduced slightly."
  - tweak: ".45 rounds now do 21.5 damage instead of 20, while 10mm bullets now do 23.5 instead of 25."
