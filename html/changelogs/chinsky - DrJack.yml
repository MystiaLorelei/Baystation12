changes: 
  - rscadd: "Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds to reach max"
  - rscadd: "Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be - increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await you"
  - rscadd: "Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing."
  - rscadd: "There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy doses is metabolized."
  - rscadd: "Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze."
