changes: 
  - rscadd: "Completely overhauls crew records. Large text fields now support paper tag formatting. Records are now accessed through a computer program. Everyone can see generic fields (name, job, rank, ..), specialized fields become visible depending on your access."
  - rscdel: "Removed old record computers of all kinds, removed PDA modules for crew record viewing."
